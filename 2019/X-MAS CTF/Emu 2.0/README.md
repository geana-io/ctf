Hey! We have found this old cartridge under a desk in the library of Lapland. It appears to be for a system called "Emu 2.0", made back in 1978. These systems don't get produced anymore, and we can't seem to find anyone that owns one.

Thankfully we have the documentation for it, so maybe we can use it to write an emulator and see what this ROM does?

The challenge is straightforward and requires you to implement a VM for the described architecture. Upon running the
ROM, the flag is printed over serial.
